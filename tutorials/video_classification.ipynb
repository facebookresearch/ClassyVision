    "In this tutorial, we will show how to train a video classification model in Classy Vision. Given an input video, the video classification task is to predict the most probable class label. This is very similar to image classification, which was covered in other tutorials, but there are a few differences that make video special. As the video duration can be long, we sample short video clips of a small number of frames, use the classifier to make predictions, and finally average the clip-level predictions to get the final video-level predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will: (1) load a video dataset; (2) configure a video model; (3) configure video meters; (4) build a task; (5) start training; Please note that these steps are being done separately in the tutorial for easy of exposition in the notebook format. As described in our [Getting started](https://classyvision.ai/tutorials/getting_started) tutorial, you can combine all configs used in this tutorial into a single config for ClassificationTask and train it using `classy_train.py`."

    "Note we specify different transforms for training and testing split. For training split, we first randomly select a size from `size_range` [128, 160], and resize the video clip so that its short edge is equal to the random size. After that, we take a random crop of spatial size 112 x 112. We find such data augmentation helps the model generalize better, and use it as the default transform with data augmentation. For testing split, we resize the video clip to have short edge of size 128, and skip the random cropping to use the entire video clip. This is the default transform without data augmentation."

    "We also need to create a model head, which consists of an average pooling layer and a linear layer, by using the `fully_convolutional_linear` head.

Since we do not use a global average pooling but an average pooling layer of kernel size `(1, 7, 7)`, the pooled feature map has shape `(2048, 1, 2, 5)`. The shape of prediction tensor from the linear layer is `(1, 2, 5, 101)`, which indicates the model computes a 101-D prediction vector densely over a `2 x 5` grid. That's why we name the head as `FullyConvolutionalLinearHead` because we use the linear layer as a `1x1` convolution layer to produce spatially dense predictions. Finally, predictions over the `2 x 5` grid are averaged."
